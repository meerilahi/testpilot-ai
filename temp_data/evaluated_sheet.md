# Mark Sheet

## Question 1

**Total Marks Awarded:** 3

### Rubric Evaluation:

- **Point 1:** 1 marks — Correct: Stomach is correctly identified as an Organ.
- **Point 2:** 1 marks — Correct: Man is correctly identified as an Organism.
- **Point 3:** 0 marks — Incorrect: Cylocose is not a valid molecule. The correct term is Glucose.
- **Point 4:** 1 marks — Correct: Ribosome is correctly identified as an Organelle.

### Feedback:

The student correctly identified the organization levels for the Stomach, Man, and Ribosome. However, the term 'Cylocose' is incorrect; it should be 'Glucose'. Ensure to use the correct terminology in future responses.

## Question 2

**Total Marks Awarded:** 3.5

### Rubric Evaluation:

- **Point 1:** 1 marks — The student correctly identified the cell type as mostly unicellular and eukaryotic, which aligns with the answer key.
- **Point 2:** 1 marks — The student correctly mentioned that the nuclear envelope is present, matching the answer key.
- **Point 3:** 0.5 marks — The student mentioned that the cell wall is either absent or made of materials other than cellulose, which is partially correct but lacks the detail about various types as mentioned in the answer key.
- **Point 4:** 1 marks — The student did not specify the mode of nutrition, but the description aligns with the possibility of being photosynthetic, heterotrophic, or a combination, so partial credit is given.

### Feedback:

The student provided a mostly accurate description of the characteristics of the Kingdom Protista. However, the description of the cell wall was partially correct and lacked detail about the various types. Additionally, the mode of nutrition was not explicitly mentioned, but partial credit was given based on the context. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could improve by providing more detailed information.

## Question 3

**Total Marks Awarded:** 2

### Rubric Evaluation:

- **Point 1:** 1 marks — Correctly identified the radiation type as beams of electrons.
- **Point 2:** 1 marks — Correctly identified the lenses as magnetic (electromagnetic lenses).
- **Point 3:** 0 marks — Incorrect magnification description. The correct description is 100 times greater than light, not up to 2 million times.
- **Point 4:** 0 marks — Incorrect description of images. The correct description is TEM shows 2D while SEM shows 3D images, not internal structure vs. surface.

### Feedback:

The student correctly identified the radiation type and the type of lenses used. However, the magnification and the description of the images were incorrect. The magnification should be described as 100 times greater than light, and the images produced by TEM and SEM should be described as 2D and 3D respectively.

## Question 4

**Total Marks Awarded:** 2

### Rubric Evaluation:

- **Point 1:** 2 marks — Correct definition of turgor, although it could be more detailed.
- **Point 2:** 0 marks — Incorrect importance. 'Maintains plant rigidity and structure' is partially correct but does not mention support to plants or stomata function.
- **Point 3:** 0 marks — Incorrect importance. 'Aids in growth by cell expansion' is partially correct but does not mention the role in stomata function or flower movement.

### Feedback:

The student provided a correct definition of turgor but missed several key points in the importance section. The importance of turgor in maintaining plant structure, supporting young tissues, aiding in stomata function, and flower movement was not fully addressed.

## Question 5

**Total Marks Awarded:** 1

### Rubric Evaluation:

- **Point 1:** 1 marks — Correctly identified that prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus while eukaryotic cells have a nucleus.
- **Point 2:** 0 marks — Incorrectly stated that prokaryotic cells have membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells do have membrane-bound organelles.
- **Point 3:** 0 marks — Incorrectly described the cell wall composition for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
- **Point 4:** 0 marks — Incorrectly described the size comparison between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

### Feedback:

The student correctly identified the difference in the nucleus between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. However, there were several inaccuracies: membrane organelles are absent in prokaryotic cells, the cell wall composition was incorrectly described, and the size comparison was incorrect. The student should review the key differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to improve their understanding.

## Question 14

**Total Marks Awarded:** 5

### Rubric Evaluation:

- **Point 1:** 3 marks — Correctly described mitochondrial enzyme as intracellular, explaining it functions inside mitochondria.
- **Point 2:** 1 marks — Correctly described the synthesis of ATP.
- **Point 3:** 0 marks — Did not provide a correct diagram for the synthesis of ATP. The provided diagram does not match the expected representation.
- **Point 4:** 1 marks — Correctly described the breaking of ATP.
- **Point 5:** 0 marks — Did not provide a correct diagram for the breaking of ATP. The provided diagram does not match the expected representation.

### Feedback:

The student correctly described mitochondrial enzyme as intracellular and provided correct descriptions for the synthesis and breaking of ATP. However, the diagrams provided for both synthesis and breaking of ATP were incorrect and did not match the expected representations. The student should focus on accurately representing the chemical processes in diagrams.

## Question 15

**Total Marks Awarded:** 1

### Rubric Evaluation:

- **Point 1:** 1 marks — Correctly identified frequent, loose stools, and pain as symptoms of diarrhea.
- **Point 2:** 0 marks — Did not specify watery nature of bowel movement and missed nausea and vomiting.
- **Point 3:** 0 marks — Did not mention bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection as causes.
- **Point 4:** 0 marks — Did not provide any description of Atherosclerosis.
- **Point 5:** 0 marks — Did not provide any description of Arteriosclerosis.

### Feedback:

The student's answer was incomplete and incorrect in several aspects. The symptoms of diarrhea were partially correct but missed key details. Causes of diarrhea were not mentioned at all. The descriptions of Atherosclerosis and Arteriosclerosis were entirely missing. The diagram provided did not contain any relevant information. Overall, the answer did not meet the expectations outlined in the answer key.
