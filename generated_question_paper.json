      "answer_key": "Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the correct responses are provided. Examples include classification and regression problems. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves identifying patterns and structures in unlabeled data. Examples include clustering and association. Applications of supervised learning include spam detection and image classification, while unsupervised learning is used in customer segmentation and anomaly detection. Limitations include the need for labeled data in supervised learning and the difficulty in interpreting results in unsupervised learning.",

      "answer_key": "The concept of 'Version Space' in machine learning helps in understanding the process of hypothesis generation and elimination by defining a set of all hypotheses that are consistent with the observed training examples. This space is delimited by the most general and most specific hypotheses, which are iteratively refined as new training examples are provided.",
