# Notes of any Subject for any test Preparation

## 1.1 Introduction to Biology

Biology is the science of life. The word "Biology" is derived from two Greek words "Bio" means 'life' and "Logos" means 'to study'. In 1736, a Swedish Scientist Carl Linneaus for the first time used the word biology. Biology has three major divisions:

(i) **Botany:** It is the study of plants.

(ii) **Zoology:** It is the study of animals.

(iii) **Microbiology:** It is the study of microorganisms e.g. viruses, bacteria and microscopic fungi.

### 1.2 Branches of Biology

Biology is a fast growing field of science. Therefore, it is divided into many specialized branches for better understanding and convenience. The following are the main branches of biology.

i. **Morphology** is the study of form, shape and structure of organisms.

ii. **Anatomy** is the study of internal structures of organisms.

iii. **Histology** is the study of the composition, structure and functions of plant and animal tissues.

### Scientific Information

In biology, "structure" means any part of the living organism that can be seen with the naked eye or with the help of microscope.

iv. **Physiology** deals with the functions of different parts of organisms and the activities occurring in them.

v. **Embryology** deals with embryo and the phenomena involved in the formation of embryo and its development into a new organism.

vi. **Taxonomy** is the study of classification of organisms and their scientific naming.

vii. **Cell Biology** or cytology is the study of cells and their organelles.

viii. **Palaeontology** is the study of fossils of past organisms. The study of fossils of plants is called Paleobotany and the study of fossils of animals is called Paleozoology.

### Scientific Information

In embryology, we study the development of an organism from a fertilized egg.

## Scientific Information

ix. Immunology deals with the body's system of defence against disease-causing microorganisms.
x. Entomology deals with the study of insects.
xi. Genetics deals with the study of transmission of characters from parents to off springs.
xii. Biotechnology is the study of the use of organisms for the benefit and welfare of humanity.
xiii. Environmental biology is the branch of biology which deals with inter-relationship of organisms and their environment.
xiv. Parasitology is the branch of biology which deals with the study of parasites and all aspects of parasitism.
xv. Socio-biology is concerned with the social behavior-of some animals such as humans, bees, ants etc. Socio-biology investigates the beneficial relationship among the animals living in the same area.
xvi. Pharmacology is the scientific study of drugs and their effects on the human body. Pharmacology analyze the synthesis and breakdown, biological activity and effects and delivery of drugs.

### 1.3 Linkage of Biology with other Fields of Study

The functions and metabolic pathways occurring in living organisms follow the principles of other fields of study like physics, chemistry, geography, economics etc. This type of linkage makes inter-disciplinary sciences. Some of the inter-disciplinary sciences are mentioned below:
1.3.1 Biophysics. is an inter-disciplinary study of understanding biological phenomena and problems using the principles and techniques of physics. It is used in physiology, bioenergetics, neurosciences, pharmacology etc. For example, photosynthesis follows the laws of physics during the absorption of light.
1.3.2 Biochemistry is concerned with chemical substances and processes that occur in organisms. It involves the structural analysis of the organic compounds that make up cells and of those that play key roles in chemical reactions of life (e.g., photosynthesis and respiration reactions).
# Introduction to Biology

## 1.3.3 Biogeography

Biogeography is the study of distribution of organisms in space and time. For example, in biogeography we study why polar bears are found only in certain parts of the arctic regions or why malaria-causing mosquitoes flourish in damp and warm areas.

## 1.3.4 Biostatistics or Biometry

Biostatistics or biometry is the application of statistical and mathematical formulas in the study of biology. It involves the design, analysis, and interpretation of research data.

## 1.3.5 Bio-economics

Bio-economics is the co-relation between biology and economics. It deals with the study of organisms from the economical point of view. In bio-economics, scientists calculate and compare the cost and profit of the biological projects e.g., production of a new variety of a crop.

## 1.4 Careers in Biology

Careers in biology: Studying biology can be immensely rewarding and exciting. There are several career paths one can follow as a biologist, such as:

### 1.4.1 Medicine and Surgery

The field of medicine is related with the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. In surgery, the defective parts of the body are repaired, replaced, or removed. One can choose these professions in the same course (MBBS) after studying biology at higher secondary level.

### 1.4.2 Fisheries

Fisheries is the profession related to the production of fish. Fisheries managers work in fish hatcheries and study fish habitats, nutrition requirements, genetics, and diseases, etc., to raise fish production. One can adopt this career after completing a bachelor or master degree in zoology.

### 1.4.3 Agriculture

A biologist can also opt-in his/her career as an agriculturalist who deals with crops and livestock. In Pakistan, there are agricultural universities where one can do professional courses in agriculture after the higher secondary education in biology. Agriculturists may work in the agriculture department, veterinary and pharmaceutical industries, food industries, farming, agricultural banks, etc.

## Science, Technology, and Society

### Penicillin

An accidental breakthrough in the world of medicine. Penicillin is the first naturally occurring and most extensively used antibiotic. It was discovered in 1928. It has enabled the physicians to treat severe infections such as meningitis, pneumonia, and gonorrhoea. The first patient was successfully treated in the United States in 1942. Penicillin helped in reducing the number of deaths.
# 1.4.4 Animal Science 

Animal science or animal husbandry deals with the breeding and raising of livestock (domestic animals). The professional course is taught in many universities and colleges after higher secondary education in biology. Graduates of these courses work in veterinary hospitals, pharmaceutical industry, livestock department and pet food industry etc.

### 1.4.5 Horticulture

After higher secondary education, you can opt for a professional course in horticulture. Horticulturist can open business and find jobs in fruits and vegetable production, landscape design, nurseries, gardens, pest management etc.

### 1.4.6 Forestry

Forestry is concerned with managing forests and growing forests to provide timber and for wildlife habitat, recreation and biodiversity management.

## Forensic science:

Forensic biologists work with police departments and other law enforcement agencies using scientific methods to discover and process evidence that can be used to detect criminals.

## Health care:

Biologists may develop public health campaigns to defeat illnesses such as tuberculosis, cancer and heart diseases. Others work to prevent the spread of rare and deadly diseases, such as dengue fever.

### 1.4.7 Farming

In farming farms are developed and maintained for animal breeding, poultry, fruit and vegetables. A student of biology after doing professional course in agriculture or animal husbandry etc. can adopt this field.

## Analysing and Interpreting:

## INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY

### 1.5 The Five Kingdoms

Robert Whittaker in 1969 classified all living organisms into five kingdoms. This is known as "Five-Kingdom System of Classification". These five kingdoms are:

1. Prokaryotae
2. Protoctista
3. Fungi
4. Plantae
5. Animalia

#### 1.5.1 Kingdom Prokaryotae (Monera)

This kingdom includes all unicellular and microscopic organisms. These organisms lack membrane-bounded nucleus and other organelles inside their cells. Their cell wall is made of murein. Examples are Bacteria and Cyanobacteria.

#### 1.5.2 Kingdom Protista or Protoctista

This kingdom included eukaryotic organisms which are usually small and having differences with the organisms of other eukaryotic kingdoms. They usually live in aquatic habitats. Algae, slime molds, protozoans (Plasmodium, Amoeba, and Paramecium) are some of the examples of this kingdom.

#### 1.5.3 Kingdom Fungi

Fungi include organisms which are all eukaryotic and multicellular. Their cell wall is made of chitin (a polysaccharide). They do not have chloroplast, so they cannot synthesize their own food and are therefore heterotrophic. The food is stored inside the body in the form of glycogen. Some of the examples are Mushrooms, Molds, Puffballs, yeast, etc.

#### 1.5.4 Kingdom Plantae

This kingdom includes multicellular and eukaryotic organisms which are autotrophic in nature. Their cell wall is made of cellulose and mostly lack centrioles inside their cells. The reserve food is in the form of starch. Examples are Brassica, Mulberry, Pinus, Ferns, etc.

#### 1.5.5 Kingdom Animalia

This kingdom includes multicellular and eukaryotic organisms which are heterotrophic in nature. These organisms lack the cell wall and centrioles are present in the cells. The reserve food is glycogen. The members of this kingdom can be split into two groups that are vertebrates and invertebrates. Animals include jellyfish, worms, insects, fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, etc.

# 1.6 Holy Quran and Biological Science 

Allah, the Creator and Sustainer of the whole universe, has guided His creatures in every possible way which can lead them to successful survival.

In the same way, He has guided human beings in their search for those basic questions which have puzzled their minds for centuries. For the material guidance and spiritual development of the human intellect, Allah has endowed humanity with the teachings. of the Holy Quran.

According to the Quranic teachings Allah is the ultimate creator of every living and non-living thing. Some of the Quranic verses in this regard are quoted below:

## اَلَّذِىَّ اَحْسَنَ كُلُّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَهُ وَيَنَا خَلَقُ الإِنْسَانِ مِنْ طِفْتٍ

Who made all things good which he created, and He began the creation of man from clay.
(Surah Al-Sajda Ayah:7)

Verily We created man from a product of wet earth;
(Surah Al-Mominoon Ayah: 12)

He created man of clay like the potter's.

Allah is Creator of all things, and He is Guardian over all things.
(Surah Al-Zumar Ayah: 62)

Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs of that which the earth groweth, and themselves, and of that which they know not!
(Surah Yaseen Ayah:36)

# 1.7 Muslim scientists and their contributions 

Muslim scientists contributed a lot of knowledge to the science of biology and medicines from 8th to 15th century. Their views were highly respected and taken as authority. Some of the famous Muslim scientists are:

### 1.7.1 Jabir Bin Hayyan (721-815 AD)

He was born in Iran and practiced medicine in Iraq. He introduced experimental chemistry and also wrote a number of books on plants and animals. Among these, "Al-Nabatat" and "Al-Hayawan" are noteworthy. He was also an astronomer, pharmacist, physician, philosopher and engineer.

### 1.7.2 Abdul Malik Aasmai (740-828 AD)

### 1.7.9 Ibn-ul-Nafees) 2 End

He was a renowned biologist of $13^{\text {th }}$ century A.D. He described the circulation of blood in human body.

### 1.8 (Levels of Biological Organization

Millions of organisms are present on the Earth. They are different from each other and range from the simplest organisms i.e. bacteria to the most complex ones i.e. human beings. The bodies of all living things are made of different parts organized in a certain manner that supports life functions. This organisation includes atoms $\rightarrow$ molecules $\rightarrow$ organelles $\rightarrow$ cells $\rightarrow$ tissues $\rightarrow$ organs $\rightarrow$ organ systems $\rightarrow$ organisms.

## Level 1: Sub-atomic Particles and Atoms: You know

that living and non-living matter is composed of simple units called atoms. Each atom is further composed of sub-atomic particles (electrons, protons and neutrons). The bodies of organisms are made of 16 kinds of elements. These elements are called bio-elements. Out of these bio-elements:

## Scientific Information

The most complex of all the matter are the living organisms. However, they are made of only 16 elements (bio-elements) out of total 123 elements.
- Only six (O, C, H, N, Ca and P) make $99 \%$ of the protoplasm.
- Other ten (K, S, Cl, Na, Mg, Fe, $\mathrm{Cu}, \mathrm{Mn}, \mathrm{Zn}$ and I) collectively make $1 \%$ of the protoplasm.


# Level 2 : Molecules and Compounds: 

You know that atoms combine through bonds and form molecules and compounds. Similarly, the atoms of bio-
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Figure 1.2: Percentage composition (by mass) of bio-elements in organisms
elements combine to form biomolecules. There are two types of bio-molecules. The bio-molecules with low molecular weight are called micro-molecules e.g. water, amino acids, glucose etc. The bio-molecules with higher molecular weights are called macro-molecules e.g. starch, protein, lipids etc.
Level 3: Organelles: Different bio-molecules combine together in a specific manner and form sub-cellular structures called organelles e.g. mitochondria, chloroplast, ribosome etc. Each organelle performs a particular function. For example, mitochondria provide energy to the cell and ribosomes prepare proteins.
Level 4: Cells: Cell is the basic structural and functional unit of an organism. It consists of many organelles such as, golgi bodies, mitochondria, lysosomes etc. which perform different specific functions inside the cell.

In unicellular organisms, a single cell makes the whole body. While in multicellular organisms, there are more levels of biological organization.

## Science, Technology and Society

The heart, brain, kidneys, eyes and arterial blood vessels are main targets of hypertension and hypotension. Due to advancement in technologies, it is now possible to transplant some of these organs, such as; heart, kidneys, liver and lungs. Kidneys are the most commonly transplanted organs; followed by the liver and then the heart. Some tissues can also be transplanted.
# Introduction to Biology

**UNIT 1**

Level 5: **Tissues:** In multicellular organisms, the cells which are similar in structure and perform similar functions make groups. Such groups of cells are called tissues. For example, in plants mesophyll tissue is made of cells which perform photosynthesis. In animals, glandular tissue is made of cells which produce secretions.

Level 6: **Organs:** Different tissues work together to perform a specific activity. Such a group of related tissues is called an organ. For example, the organ stomach is made of two major tissues. Its epithelial (glandular) tissue secretes gastric juice for the digestion of proteins while its muscular tissue contracts and grinds food.

Level 7: **Organ Systems:** The organs in turn coordinate and constitute an organ system which performs a particular function e.g. blood circulatory system in animals. The blood circulatory system is composed of organs like heart, arteries, veins and capillaries.

Level 8: **Organism:** Different organ systems then collectively form a whole organism. In case of man, different organ systems such as blood circulatory system, respiratory system, digestive system etc. work in coordination. Similarly in plants, root and shoot systems constitute plant body.

**Levels higher than the organism level:**

- The group of similar individuals in an area is called a population.
- Two or more populations of different organisms living together make a community.
- The community and the non-living components of an area make an ecosystem.
- All the ecosystems of the planet Earth are collectively called the biosphere.

**Analysing and Interpreting:**

Enlist five tissues, organs and systems of human body.

# INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY 

## 1.9 Cellular Organization

All organisms are made of either one (unicellular) or many cells (multi-cellular). Moreover, there are certain organisms which are unicellular but they live in groups and make colonies. This is called colonial form of organism.
(i) Unicellular Organization: Unicellular organisms such as Amoeba, Chlamydomonas, Euglena etc. have bodies made of single cells and the work is distributed among different organelles of the cells. So there is division of labour among different organelles. Although these are single celled organisms yet they are capable of carrying out all the vital activities of life. Their single cells are capable of respiration, digestion, excretion, reproduction etc. These types of organisms can live independently.
(ii) Colonial Organization: Volvox is a green alga. It is a common example of unicellular colonial organisms. It lives in water. Hundreds of volvox cells make a small volvox colony Many small colonies make a big colony. Most of the functions are performed by every cell. However, an individual volvox cell cannot live independently as the cells of colony are dependent on each other. For example, there are cells which are specialized for mobility while other cells are for reproduction. Therefore, the division is above the cellular level and this is a trend towards more complex division of labour in multi-cellular organisms.

# UNIT 1 

## INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGY

(iii) Multicellular Organization: In multicellular organization, cells are organized into tissues which inturn form organs and organs make organ systems. All plants and animals have multicellular organization.

The body of a plant is made of vegetative and reproductive organs. Roots, stem, branches and leaves are the vegetative organs while flowers are the reproductive organs of plants. For example, Mustard plant has multicellular organization.

Similarly, the body of an animal is made of different organ systems e.g. digestive system, respiratory system, blood circulatory system, nervous system, reproductive system etc. For example, frog shows multicellular organization.
