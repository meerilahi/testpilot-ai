Title: Solving A Biological Problem

# Notes of any Subject for any test Preparation

## Table 2

### Quantitative Observations

- Deal with numbers
- Can be measured
- Length, height, area, temperature, volume, weight, cost etc.

### Qualitative Observations

- Deal with description
- Can be observed but not measured
- Colour, texture, smell, taste etc.

### Hypothesis

Biologist uses observations to develop a possible answer to a biological problem. Such tentative answer is called a hypothesis. A good hypothesis has the following characteristics:

- It is based upon the observations made by the biologist.
- It is a proposed statement to answer the problem.
- It is testable through experiments.
- There is always a way to disprove the hypothesis after experimentation.

A hypothesis is assumed as the possible answer. Biologist may make more than one hypothesis for a single problem. There is a need to test all hypothesis so that the true one can be selected. This testing is done by experimentation. But before going to experimentation, biologist makes deductions from each hypothesis.

### Deductions

Deductions are the logical consequences of hypothesis. For making deductions, the biologist takes hypothesis as true and draws out the expected results called deductions. It involves the use of "if" and "then". For example, if all birds have wings then pigeon is a bird. Deductions help the biologist to do experiments.

### Experiments

It is the most important step of biological method. Biologist performs experiments on his hypothesis and checks the deductions. Through experiments he can find that deductions of some hypothesis have come true while others have not. In this way, the hypothesis are proved as true or false.

### Scientific Information

- **Hypothesis:** "All plant cells have a nucleus".
- **Deduction:** "If all plant cells have a nucleus, then a nucleus will be observed in each cell of a blade of grass under the microscope".
The false hypothesis are rejected while the true ones are accepted. Biologist makes new deductions from the accepted hypothesis. Then he performs further experiments and confirms the correctness of hypothesis.
There could be a possibility that the results of experiment do not support any hypothesis. Under these conditions, new hypothesis are developed and tested.
vi) Conclusions and Reporting

Biologist collects data from his experiments. He analyze the data statistically to reach some conclusions. He publishes his conclusions in the form of research articles in scientific journals and books. He also presents his conclusions in science seminars at national and international levels. It allows other people to verify the results or apply the knowledge to solve other problems.

## Scientific Information

During experiments, there are two arrangements i.e. "experimental group" and "control group". Both groups are kept under the same conditions except for the condition which is being tested.
For example, you want to do an experiment to test the necessity of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. You will arrange two similar plants. You will provide soil, water and sunlight to both plants. You will not provide carbon dioxide to one plant (experimental group). While you will provide carbon dioxide to the other plant (control group). The necessity of carbon dioxide will be proved when photosynthesis does not occur in the experimental group but occurs in the control group.

## Scientific Information

More than 2000 years ago, physicians were familiar with malaria. At those times, it was known as "the disease of chills and fevers". In human history, malaria has killed more people than any other disease.

# 2.2 Example of Biological Method 

Now we will see the different steps of biological method by looking at the history of biological problems related to malaria.

Biological Problem 1: What is the cause of malaria?
Step 1: Observations
The people and physicians in ancient times (more than 2000 years ago) had some observations on malaria. For example;
i. The patients of this disease experienced recurring attacks of chills and fevers.
ii. The disease was more common among people who lived in low marshy areas.

## UNIT 2

### SOLVING A BIOLOGICAL BURDEN

iii. When some volunteers drank the water from marshes, they did not develop malaria. Thus a new observation was made i.e. the disease did not result from drinking the water of marshes.

Then they began thinking that stagnant water of marshes poisoned the air. When people breathed in this "bad air", they got malaria. That is why they gave the name malaria to this disease. The Italian words "mala" means "bad" and "aria" means "air".

These observations did not help much for solving the problem i.e. "what is the cause of malaria?"

Two hundred years later, it was proved that many diseases are caused by micro-organisms like bacteria. In 1878 a French Physician Laveran studied the ancient observations and work. He observed the blood of a malarial patient under microscope. He noticed some microorganisms in the blood. He won the Nobel Prize for his discoveries.

Five years after Laveran, the same microorganism was observed in the blood of malarial patients and this microorganism was given a name of Plasmodium.

### Step 2: Hypothesis and Deduction

Biologists further built upon the ancient observations and the discovery of Laveran. They developed a hypothesis i.e. "Plasmodium is the cause of malaria." For testing the hypothesis through experiment, biologists made a deduction; "If Plasmodium is the cause of malaria, then all malarial patients should have Plasmodium in their blood."

### Discovery of Quinine

In 17th century, malaria was a major disease in Europe. When America was discovered, many medicinal plants were sent from America to Europe. The bark of a tree quina-quina was very suitable for curing fevers. Its demands increased day by day in Europe. Some dishonest exporters began to export the bark of a similar tree, cinchona in place of quina-quina.

This dishonesty proved much beneficial. It was found that cinchona bark was excellent for treating malaria. It was then discovered that cinchona bark contained a chemical quinine that is effective in treating malaria. Quinine was the only remedy for malaria from the 17th to the 20th century.
# Step 3: Experiment and Results 

In order to test the hypothesis "Plasmodium is the cause of malaria", biologists carried out the following experiment.
i. They examined the blood of 100 malarial patients under microscope. It was labelled as the experimental group.
ii. They also examined the blood of 100 healthy persons under microscope. It was labelled as the control group.

Results: It was observed that all the malarial patients had Plasmodium in their blood; whereas the blood of healthy persons was free from Plasmodium. These results supported the hypothesis that Plasmodium is the cause of malaria. So it was taken as the solution of a biological problem.

## Biological Problem 2: How is Plasmodium transmitted to human beings?

## Step 1: Observations:

Biologists were having the following observations:

- Malaria is associated with marshes.
- Drinking water of marshes did not cause malaria.

In 1883 an American physician, Albert Freeman Africanus King (A. F. A. King), listed 20 more observations about malaria. Some important observations of King were:
i. People who slept in open places suffered from malaria more than the people who slept indoors.
ii. Individuals who slept near a smoky fire usually did not get malaria.
iii. People who used mosquito nets suffered from malaria less than the ones who did not use mosquito nets.

## Science, Technology and Society

The life expectancy of people has been improved by controlling many of the infectious diseases. Tuberculosis (T.B), once known as a great killer disease, is one common examples that have been effectively controlled due to research in vaccination.
# UNIT 2 

Step 2: Hypothesis and Deduction:
On the basis of these observations A. F. A. King suggested a hypothesis: "Mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium." In order to test the hypothesis, following deduction was made:
"If mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium, then Plasmodium should be present in mosquitoes."

## Step 3: Experiment and Results

Ronald Ross was a British army physician who worked in India in 1880's. He performed important experiments to test the above deduction. He also received Nobel Prize for his work on the transmission of Plasmodium. He allowed a female Anopheles mosquito to bite a malarial patient. He killed the mosquito and found Plasmodium multiplying in mosquito's stomach. In the next experiment, he thought to allow an infected mosquito (having Plasmodium) to bite a healthy person. If the hypothesis was true, the healthy person would have gotten malaria. But he did not use human beings for such risky experiment. Ross performed his experiment again but used sparrows instead of human beings. He allowed a female Culex mosquito to bite a sparrow suffering from malaria. He killed some of the mosquitoes and studied them. He found that Plasmodium multiplied in the walls of the mosquito's stomach and then moved into the mosquito's salivary glands. He allowed infected mosquitoes to bite healthy sparrows. Ross found that these healthy sparrows got malaria. When he examined the blood of these previously healthy sparrows, he found many Plasmodium in it. In this way, biologists had got the solution of the $2^{\text {nd }}$ biological problem (How Plasmodium is transmitted to human beings?).The hypothesis (Mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium.) was proved true and taken as the solution of biological problem.

## Scientific Information

Patient suffering from malaria have Plasmodium in their blood. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites a malarial patient, it sucks blood from him/her. Thus the plasmodium enters the body of the mosquito. When the infected mosquito bites a healthy person, it injects Plasmodium in his blood.

### 2.3 Experiments on Human Beings

In the end, the hypothesis was tested by experiments on human beings. In 1898 Italian biologists allowed an Anopheles mosquito to bite a malarial patient. The
infected mosquito was then allowed to bite a healthy man. This person later became ill with malaria. In this way, it was confirmed that mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium and so are involved in the spread of malaria.

### 2.4 Theory, Law and Principle

We know that when a hypothesis has been proved by experiments, scientists keep on trying to do more experiments on it. When a hypothesis is proved by many experiments, scientists develop more hypotheses from it and test them experimentally. If the new hypothesis are again proved, the original hypothesis becomes a theory. A scientific theory explains a phenomenon. Scientists try their best to disprove the theory by disproving the hypothesis. If a theory is proved again and again by experiments, it becomes a law or principle. A scientific law is a uniform or constant fact of nature. The examples of biological laws are Hardy-Weinberg's law and Mendel's laws of inheritance.

### 2.5 Data Organization and Data Analysis

We have studied that researchers collect and analyze the data (information such as names, dates, numbers, values etc.) at various steps in scientific method. This data helps them to make hypotheses from observations and to conclude results from experiments. In order to use data in scientific method, scientists have to organize and analyze it. Scientists organize the collected data in the form of graphs, tables, flow charts, maps and diagrams. The collected data is analyzed by using statistical methods like ratios and proportions. A ratio is a relationship with respect to relative size between two quantities of the same kind. A pure number to a pure number; an amount of money to an amount of money; a number of people to a number of people. Proportion means to join two equal ratios.

$$a : b = c : d$$

"a" and "d" are called the extremes, "b" and "c" are called the means. The product of the extremes is equal to the product of means. When three values in a proportion are known, the fourth one (a) can be calculated by using this rule. For example, if a biologist wants to know how many sparrows would be infected with malaria if he allows *Culex* mosquito to bite 50 sparrows. Previously in one of his findings, he already noticed that 6 out of 10 sparrows get malaria if bitten by *Culex* mosquito.

### Science, Technology and Society

The researchers conduct their research following the scientific method. They follow all the steps of the method. Initially they develop the hypothesis through certain observations. Through the observations, deduction or induction is made. Finally, experiments are conducted to prove or disprove the hypothesis.

Here he applies proportion rule.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& a: b=c: d \\
& a: 50=6: 10 \\
& a / 50=6 / 10 \\
& a \times 10=50 \times 6 \\
& a=30
\end{aligned}
$$

It means that if he allows Culex mosquito to bite 50 sparrows, 30 out of them will get malaria.

Proportion method can be used to draw conclusions. As in the above case we can find the fourth proportion of the data if three proportions are already available.

# 2.6 Mathematics - as an integral part of scientific process 

Mathematical rules have been used in biology for many decades. Recently, however, because of developments in our understanding of biology, applications of mathematical rules in all sciences has increased tremendously. For example, the research projects, such as population studies, drug studies and sequencing of plants' and animals' DNA, require mathematical knowledge for organising and analysing the data.
# KEY POINTS

- The scientific method has four steps.
- First steps is to make observations, second step is to make hypothesis and deduction, third step is to conduct experiments and fourth step is to analyze the data and draw conclusion.
- When more research is carried out on a hypothesis and all the available evidence favours it then it becomes theory.
- Scientific laws must be simple, true, universal and absolute.
- Scientific laws represent the corner stone of scientific discovery.
- Recorded observations and information are called data.
- Biology can be better understood by the use of Mathematics principles.
- Malaria is a disease that is transmitted to people by infected mosquitoes.
- Malaria is very common throughout the world. People with Malaria typically have cycles of chills and fever.
