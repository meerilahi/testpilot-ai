Title: Making of Pakistan

When Lahore Resolution was passed, Quaid-e-Azam tried to unite the Muslims of Indo-Pak Subcontinent on one platform. He visited different parts of India and informed the Muslims about wrong policies of the Indian National Congress that would endanger the Muslims identity. He tried his best to get the support of Muslim leaders of other parties on the demand of separate homeland for Muslims. As a result a special group of Deoband scholars under the leadership of Shabir Ahmad Usmani lent hands to Quaid-e-Azam. Due to the political insight of Quaid-e-Azam, the Muslim leaders of Bengal and Punjab from other parties joined the Muslim League.

At first the British rulers did not give any importance to the Lahore Resolution but later on as a result of the disciplined campaign of the Muslims under the guidance of Quaid-e-Azam, they accepted the demand for Pakistan.

# CRIPPS MISSION (1942) 

The Second World War started in 1939. The British Viceroy had declared participation in the was without consulting Indians. The Congress resigned from provincial governments on this basis. Japan also jumped into war against the allied Nations in 1940-41. From the very beginning the Congress and Gandhi were trying to make the people turn against the Britain and for the establishment of Congress rule. In such grave situation, the British Government announced to send a mission, known as Cripps Mission, Cripps
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
(Quald-e-Azam \& Sir Stafford Cripps)
reached India for solution of political crises of India. Cripps after analyzing the Indian conditions gave some proposals for solution.

# Proposals: 

(i) These proposals included India's Independence at the end of war.
(ii) Newly constitution adheres to the principles of fedration and defend the rights of minority.
(iii) He proposed that after the war a Constituent Assembly would be formed, members of which would be elected by the members of Lower Houses of Provincial Assemblies through the principles of proportional representation. In this Assembly autonomous states will also be given representation.
(iv) Constitution framed by the Assembly would be acceptable to the British Gqvernment.
(v) An agreement would be made between the Constituent Assembly and the British Crown for the settlement of all the issues.
(vi) It was proposed that any province will be given a right to opt out of the Union.
(vii) During the war, total responsibility of defense would be in the hands of British Government.

## Reaction:

The Cripps proposals were rejected by both Congress and the Muslim League. The Congress rejected these on the ground that there were no immediate steps for Indian independence but the time was given after the war and opposed the non-acceding clause under which the provinces had an option to stay out of the proposed Union.

The Muslim League also rejected the scheme because it did not concede her demand for Pakistan in clear terms. The Muslim League also had the reservations that they were not taken into confidence in discussion. Though the Cripps Mission returned unsuccessful but there was a positive steps towards Muslims interest that the British leaders for the first time accepted the Principles of Indian Partition by giving right of separation to the provinces from the Indian Union. Thus the possibility was seen that in future, a separate homeland for the Muslims would be established in the western and eastern regions of India.
# C.R. FORMULA (1944) 

During the "World War", Congress made great efforts for the withdrawal of British Government from India and transfer of power to the Congress. In these efforts the Congress ignored the Muslim League. The British had known the Congress trickery. On the other hand, Muslim League was being organized under the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam and they made it clear to the British that the sentiments and feelings of 08-crore Muslims of India cannot be ignored. In such a situation when Congress and Muslim League adopted different ways, a Congress Leader of Madras Chakarwati Raj Gopal Acharia tried to bring together both the parties. Because he had realized that the Congress could not make any agreement without the cooperation of the Muslim League. In the same way, the British Government will not be agreed to accept any demand of Congress contrary to the willing of Muslim League. Gopal Acharia presented a resolution in the Madras Assembly wherein the Congress was asked to accept demand for Pakistan with appropriate change and hold dialogue with Muslim League regarding Federal Government.

The important points of C.R.Formula are the following.

1. The Muslim League will confirm the demand of Indian liberation and will co-operate with Congress regarding the establishment of a temporary government in the interim period.
2. After the war a commission will determine the Muslim majority districts in the North West and the North East. In these areas separation from India will be decided through referendum and if the majority decides for separation, then this will be imposed without any prejudice.

(Quaid-e-Azam \& Mahatma Gandhi)
3. In case of separation a mutual agreement will be made regarding defense, commerce, communication and other important matters.
The Congress showed great concern over these proposals and the Indian National Congress committee rejected it with majority. Personal attacks were made on Acharia. He resigned from Congress and assembly with great protest over this attitude. On the other hand Quaid-e-Azam indicated certain flaws in formula and pointed out the ambiguities. He told that if Acharia is ready to accept "Pakistan" then why he is reluctant to accept Lahore Resolution. In spite of all the flaws, C.R. Formula is important in history because for the first time, the Indian Partition was accepted, in principle by a Congress leader.

# GANDHI - JINNAH TALKS (1944) 

In the light of C.R. Formula, talks were held between Quaid-e-Azam and Gandhi in September, 1944 at the Quaid's residence. In addition to the meetings twenty one letters were also exchanged but no agreement was made. Gandhi participated in these talks in personal capacity and not as a representative of the Congress or Hindus which was not free of doubts for Quaid-e-Azam. In these talks Gandhi once again refused the Muslim separate nationality, Gandhi took the stand that in a time in history if a great number of Indian changed their religion, they became Muslims but their nationality did not change. They are people of the same nationality. In response Quaid-e-Azam strongly defended the separate nationality of the Muslims. He said that the Indian Muslims are separate nation having their own culture and civilization, language, literature, art and architecture, values, code of conduct, laws, history, customs and traditions. Gandhi also insisted on the withdrawal of $3^{\text {rd }}$ power, the British from India and the mutual differences will be solved later on.

Quaid-e-Azam argued that internal problems of the Hindus and the Muslims should be solved first, then the British will leave India easily. Otherwise the Muslims will come under the permanent domination of Hindu
majority in India. These negotiations ended unsuccessful due to the different viewpoints of both the leaders but proved very important for Quaid-e-Azam and the Muslim League. This was for the first time that Mr. Gandhi was brought to negotiate about the partition of India. Due to these talks, Quaid-e-Azam removed many doubts regarding Pakistan.

# SHIMLA CONFERENCE 1945 

An effort was made for the solution of the constitutional problem of the Indo - Pak Subcontinent and to organize war against the Japanese in the world war. Governor General Lord Wavell declared a plan in June 1945 in which he intended the reformation of Executive Council of Governor General. He also made it clear that this council will represent all organized parties. Hindus and Muslims will be given equal representation in it. This council will be including interior, finance and foreign affairs except defense and Governor General and all the powers will be given to Indians. To discuss the plan, liceroy called the leading Indian politicians to Simla. The conference was held n $25^{\text {th }}$ June 1945. There came severe differences between the congress and the Muslim League regarding representation of Hindu Muslims proportion and nomination of representatives of other sects. The Muslim League was of the view that all the five Muslims representatives will be nominated by the Muslim league while Abul Kalam Azad and other leaders of the congress were not agreed to this. Likewise Khizar Hayat Twana leader of the Unionist Party of Punjab, also opposed Quaid-i-Azam.

Viceroy asked for list of representatives from both the parties. Quaid-e-Azam refused by saying that first of all this principle may be accepted that Muslim League will nominate the Muslim representatives.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
(Quaid-e-Azam \& Lord Wavell)
That was impossible for the Viceroy to act upon the proposal of temporary arrangement of government without the cooperation of the Muslim League. So he himself admitted the failure of the conference and declared that he failed to bring an agreement between the different parties of India. However, it was decided that elections will be held to know the party representative position of the parties.

# GENERAL ELECTIONS 1945 - 46 

After elections in Britain, the Indian Viceroy Lord Wavell announced elections in India too. Elections to the central legislature were held in December 1945. Both major parties of India, the Congress and the Muslim League took active part in elections. But both adopted different stand on the freedom of Subcontinent and constitutional problems. The Congress contested elections on the slogan of United India while the slogan of the Muslim league was "Pakistan". During the elections Quaid-e-Azam and the Muslim League addressed the Muslims and said that if they want to see the future of the Muslims safe, then they should vote to the Muslim League for Pakistan otherwise they would go into permanent slavery of the congress. As a result of elections the Muslim league won all the Muslim seats in the central legislature. In the Central assembly, 30 seats out of 100 were specified for Muslims, all won by Muslim League. After this, in the beginning of 1946 elections for 11 provincial assemblies were held. 495 seats were reserved for the Muslims in provincial assemblies. The Muslim League won 439 seats. Therefore, Muslims League won 89\% of the provincial assemblies seats. Muslim League got majority in all the provinces except NWFP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Thus the congress nominated candidates for the Muslim seats were badly defeated. In majority constituencies, securities of the Congress Muslim candidates were forfeited.

These elections were very important in the history of India. As a result, the Muslim League once a looser party in the elections of 1937, became a
successful one.
These elections made true the claim of Quaid-e-Azam from the last decade that the Muslim League is the only representative party of the Muslims. These elections also proved that the only solution of the problems of India is to accept the demand for Pakistan. Consequently the Congress leaders unwillingly accepted the demand of the Muslims for the partition of India's and representative status of Muslim League.

# CONVENTION OF ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLIES 1946 (Delhi Convention) 

An all India Muslims Legislators convention was held in Delhi in April, 1946. More than 500 members from all India participated in the convention. Some minority members also participated in convention. In the beginning session Quaid-e-Azam stress upon the demand for Pakistan in detail. He pointed out the dangers to be faced by the Muslims in case of congress rule. However, he repeated that no power can stop Muslims from their destination. In this Conference, Hussain Shaheed Suhrawardi from Bengal presented a resolution in which an independent and autonomous Pakistan was demanded consisting of Punjab, NWFP, Balochistan and Sindh in the North West, Asam and Bengal in the North East was demanded. He also told categorically that neither united India nor one constituent assembly is acceptable to the Muslims. Therefore, separate legislative assemblies should be formed for Muslim Pakistan and Hindu's Hindustan to prepare constitution for both the countries. If this demand is accepted then Muslim League is ready to join interim government otherwise they will propose line of action by themselves.

Prior to this the Muslims League had proposed the establishment of separate states for Indian Muslims in its Lahore session in March, 1940. Later on, to avoid any ambiguity this demand was amended in $28^{\text {th }}$ session of All India Muslim League in Madras (1941), through which a state was proposed in the Muslim majority areas in the North West and North East.
# CABINET MISSION PLAN 1946 

Cabinet Mission is an important turning point in the freedom Movement of Muslims of Indo-Pak Subcontinent. After the failure of Cripps Mission, the British Government sent a Mission of three members of British Cabinet to search for the possible solution of the Indian problems. Mission on arrival at India met with the leaders including Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Gandhi from Congress and Quaid-e-Azam from the Muslim league. Quaid-eAzam representing the Muslims insisted on the establishment of Pakistan while Congress insisted on United India. The Cabinet Mission during discussion was convinced about the causes of separation from Hindus and opposed the idea of Pakistan on the basis that it is impracticable.

Several sessions of discussions were held between the Muslim league, the Congress and Members of British cabinet but the parties could not agree at any formula. Therefore, at the end, the Cabinet Mission submitted the proposals on $16^{\text {th }}$ May, 1946. These proposals can be divided into two parts, one the short term and second the long term proposals. According to the short term proposals the party which will accept these proposals will be invited to be included in the interim government. As per long term proposals, it was mentioned that all provinces of India will be divided into three groups.
$\because$ Group (A) included the Hindu Majority Provinces i.e. U.P., Madras, Bombay, Central Provinces, Orisa and Bihar.

- Group (B) included the Muslim Majority Provinces i.e. Punjab, NWFP(Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Sindh and Balochistan.
- Group (C) also included the Muslims Majority Provinces of Asam and Bengal.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)

Cabinet Mission members meeting with Quaid-e-Azam
There will be a central executive consisting of all the groups having defense, communication and finance departments. Important thing in these proposals was that if a province desired separation from any group, after ten years, will have the right of separation.

The Cabinet Mission's proposals were accepted by Quaid-e-Azam and the Muslims League after showing some reservations. Though the claim for Pakistan was not accepted in these proposals but there was an ambiguous concept of making of Pakistan that the province could be separated from the centre after ten years. Congress was very happy with the point that the Cabinet Mission had rejected the demand for partition of India. However regarding consent of provinces in formation of group and limitation of powers of legislative assembly, Gandhi and other Hindu leaders gave such statements which put Quaid-e-Azam and other leaders of Muslim League into doubts.

After becoming president of the Congress on $10^{\text {th }}$ July, 1946, Jawahir Lal Nehru gave a statement in Bombay that when Congress will join the constituent assembly, it will be free to make change in the Cabinet Mission plan. This statement of Nehru compelled Quaid-e-Azam and the Muslim League to reconsider the decision of acceptance of Cabinet Mission plan. They were worried that the Congress will amend the constitution due to its majority in assembly and the concept of Pakistan could be finished in the long term plan. Quaid-e-Azam and Muslim League took strong notice of this unwise statement of Nehru and protested severely before the British government. On the other hand the Muslim League called the meeting of Muslim League Council on 29 July 1946, wherein a resolution was placed to withdraw the approval of her Cabinet Mission plan. The resolution was passed unanimously.
On the appeal of Quaid-e-Azam "Yaum-e-Rast Iqdam" (Direct Action Day) was observed on $16^{\text {th }}$ August, 1946. Muslim League appealed the Muslims to protest against the wrong policies of the government and in favour of claim for Pakistan. For the first time in history of Muslim League, this was the huge protest against the British government. Thousands of worker were arrested and sent to jail.

# FORMATION OF INTERIM GOVERNMENT 1946 - 1947 

No understanding was made till now between Congress and the Muslim League regarding Cabinet Mission plan but Viceroy Lord Wavell knew the fact that any step taken without the consent of these two parties can push the country into a civil war. So he started talks with both the parties for the establishment of combined interim government. After consulting the Cabinet Mission, Viceroy announced on $16^{\text {th }}$ June, 1946, that in interim government, Congress will have six, Muslim five and minorities three representatives. No party will have the right to criticize the nominated candidates. Equal important departments will be given to both the parties. This was also notified that if any party will not have to accept the Cabinet Missions proposals, will not be included in the interim government. In such condition, Viceroy will invite other party to form the interim government.

On $25^{\text {th }}$ June, 1946, the working committee of the Muslim League agreed to the conditions and decided to join the interim government, because the Muslim League wanted to live peacefully and participation of the Muslim Provinces proposed by Mission in Group B and C was considered the important development towards Pakistan. On the other side Congress rejected the plan by showing her reservations. According to the promise, interim government should have to be formed by representatives of Muslim League without congress but Viceroy and Labour Party government of Britain were unable to form a government of India without congress because of their financial and commercial interests. Quaid-e-Azam reminded the Viceroy his terms and protested against his attitude. But Viceroy did not want to do anything without the cooperation of Congress and the Muslim League.
Likewise Muslim League felt that she can do for the safety of the Muslims in difficult time within the government effectively. Therefore, the Muslim League nominated her five representatives for the formation of interim government. Therefore, Lord Wavell gave Nehru the invitation for the establishment of interim government. During this time, efforts were continued to include the Muslim League in the interim government. Because during protest of the Muslim League hundreds of lives had been lost due to communal riots in Calcutta and sectarian tension in other cities of India.

Congress wanted to keep Muslim League away from the government by giving representation to non-leaguer Muslims. Meanwhile, the Government of India had felt that peace cannot be established without Muslim League. Likewise Muslim League felt that she can do for the safety of the Muslims in difficult time within the government effectively. Therefore, Muslims League nominated her five representatives. They were Liaqat Ali Khan, I. I. Chundregar, Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar, Ghazanfar Ali Khan and one Achooth (untouchable) Hindu Jugandar Nath Mandal. Small number of the Muslims officers of that time specially Chaudhri Muhammad Ali who later on became Prime Minister of Pakistan, worked hard day and night and lent a hand to Liaqat Ali Khan. And very soon the Congress felt that they have made a mistake of giving the finance department to the Muslim League because all the congress Ministers were on the mercy of Ministry of Finance, Credit of the last Budget of United India also goes to Liaqat Ali Khan who made such a Budget in which important steps were taken to eliminate poverty. Taxes were levied on industrialists to meet the government's expenditures. An Inquiry Commission was also proposed to check the Tax evasion. His poor friendly budget was very much appreciated but very soon the Hindu industrialists showed grievances to the Congress against imposition of tax. These were the people who provided money to the Congress but Congress could not even opposed the budget because its claim of welfare of the poors would have been exposed.
Joint meeting of the Ministers of interim government could not be held thus joining the interim government became a cause of further distance instead of alliance. At that time Sardar Patail of Congress who was interior minister in government, reached the conclusion that the only solution of the problem of India is her partition.

# THE THIRD JUNE PLAN 1947 

The British Prime Minister declared in February, 1947, that Britain will give Government of India to the Indian before June, 1948. With this declaration, Viceroy Lord Wavell was replaced by Lord Mountbatten. Lord Mountbatten came to India and tried his best to keep India united in which he failed. So there was no other way except partition of India. For this purpose he made a plan after detail consultation with the leaders of all leading parties and his friends and sent to the British crown for approval. Before sending this plan to Britain, the Congress leader, Nehru was kept informed as he was in favour of that plan. Quaid-e-Azam and Muslim League was left unknown. Plan was approved by London and thus this plan was known as $3^{\text {rd }}$ June plan.

Following are the points of $3^{\text {rd }}$ June plan:

1) Separate Sessions will be held of Muslims and Non- Muslim Members of the Assemblies of Punjab and Bengal. In these sessions if any one group was in favour of division of respective Province, then the Province will be divided into two parts.
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
(Meeting of the 3rd June)
2) In case of partition of the Provinces, a commission will be made to determine the boundaries.
3) Sindh Provincial Assembly would decide in a special session to join India or Pakistan.
4) The future of NWFP (presently Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) would be decided by voters of the Province through referendum that they want to join Pakistan or India.
5) The decision of Balochistan will be made by Shahi Jarga and members of Municipal Committee Quetta.
6) District Sylhet of Asam Province will decide through referendum either to join Muslim majority Bengal or not.

A meeting of the Muslim League Council was held in Delhi on $10^{\text {th }}$ June, 1947, wherein it was decided that though they are not in favour of division of Bengal and Punjab but to accept the $3^{\text {rd }}$ June plan as a whole for the sake of transfer of power.

The Indian National Congress Committee Session was held on $14^{\text {th }}$ June, 1947, where in $3^{\text {rd }}$ June plan was accepted reluctantly but this was also told that "Geography, Mountains and the sea determine India. No human power can change it. Congress Committee believe that when the current hatred would diminish, then the Indian dispute will be seen in its true picture". This resolution of the Congress Committee reveals that they accepted the Indian Partition plan in compulsion.

# PARTITION OF INDIA AND ESTABLISHMENT OF PAKISTAN 

According to the $3^{\text {rd }}$ June, plan the Provinces of Punjab and Bengal were decided to be divided. For this purpose a British lawyer, Radcliffe was appointed as Chairman unanimously to demarcate the boundaries. In case of disagreement last decision was to be given by Radcliffe. Several sessions of both the Group of Boundary Commission i.e. Bengal and Punjab were held but representatives of the congress and the Muslim league could not agree on any
point. On $17^{\text {th }}$ August, 1947, Radcliffe award was declared which gave some Muslim majority areas, for example district Gordaspur to India. Non Muslims were in majority in only one Tehsil Pathankot of District Gordaspur. In those area the head works of rivers to irrigate Pakistan were given to India which later on created the canal water dispute. Likewise Calcutta, the capital of Bengal was given to India and demand of the Muslim League was to hold referendum in Calcutta because Muslim League expected the poor and destitute Hindus will also vote in favour of Pakistan along with Muslim minority. But the British did not agree with this demand of the Muslim League. Thus Calcutta, the place of great economic sources went to India.

This award shows that some leading government officer played vital role to damage Pakistan and to favour Congress. In spite of all these injustices Quaid-e-Azam showed statesmanship and told "Based on injustice, this award cannot be called constitutional. This award reflects the bad intention. Here political decisions are made instead of constitutional but as a prestigious nation we are bound of this award".

According to the $3^{\text {rd }}$ June 1947, plan, Muslim majority of Eastern Bengal and Western Punjab voted in favour of Pakistan. Constituent Assembly of Sindh, Shahi Jirga of Balochistan and members of Municipal Committee Quetta and people of NWFP (presently Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) decided to join Pakistan through referendum. Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah came to Karachi on $7^{\text {th }}$ August 1947. He was elected as president of assembly in the session of first constituent assembly of Pakistan on $11^{\text {th }}$ August, 1947. After three days Lord Mountbatten addressed the legislative assembly and thus Pakistan came into being on $14^{\text {th }}$ August 1947 and Quaid-e-Azam was appointed as the first Governor General of Pakistan.

# BRITISH COLONIZATION 

After Industrial Revolution in Europe, great changes came in the lives of the people. Industrialists searched markets for their products outside Europe. The British reached India to export their products and to obtain raw
materials for industries, Sir Thomas Roe spent some time in the Court of Mughal King Jahangir and got some privileges from the King for trade in Bengal. The British slowly increased trade activities, there they studied the situation of India and were planning to occupy it. The mutual differences, lack of interest of the rulers and deteriorating condition of peace
![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)
and comforts provided an opportunity to the British for making place in India. The development of modern art and science gave them upper hand over Indians. In 1757, the British defeated Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah in the Battle of Plassey and marched towards southern India where Haidar Ali and sultan Tipu strongly resisted for some time but at last in 1799, they were also defeated. British reached Delhi in 1803 and the Mughal emperors due to their inefficiency became pensioners of British. In 1857, the people of India waged the war of independence against British but due to the modern sciences, military equipment and advancement of training, the British became victorious and Indians faced defeat. At last, the British rule came to an end in 1947 as result of freedom of India and Pakistan.

# AIMS AND POLICIES 

## ADMINISTRATION

Arrival of the British in India greatly affected the sciences and arts, customs and traditions, culture and the way of thinking of the people of this area. The British set up an effective administrative machinery to rule over
India. They got the favour of small but influential group of India and strengthened their government. On the other hand they divided India into provinces and districts and provided an effective administration but people were on the mercy of Khans or landlords of the area and administration.

# EDUCATION SYSTEM 

In order to make aware the Indians of the modern sciences, the British established educational institutions. In 1857, universities were established in Madras, Calcutta and Bombay. Beside this with the cooperation of local people many schools, colleges and other educational institutions were set up. Western sciences and arts were taught in these institutions. The aim was to create such a group to run the government business, together with them that they can prolong their government in India. The second great draw back in this education system was that, it was based on class division. High standard institutions were established for high class and second and third class institutions for middle and lower class people. Apart from these institutions of religious education (Madrasas) were running separately, which have nothing to do with study of modern sciences. Resultantly, the society became a prey to more class distribution. A great gulf took place between the modern educated people and the traditional religious scholars.

## ECONOMIC SYSTEM

Before the British imperialists, India carried on trade with other countries of the world and so many things were also exported. During this whole period India never faced any shortage but British imperialists, in organized manner brought here such changes in economy. For example heavy taxes were levied that finished the exports of India and became a country of imports to the extent that imports of food items also started. The British did not encourage here the industrial development like Canada and
Australia. Only raw materials were exported from India and English Manufactures were imported. The feudal system was left as it was, through which on one side industrial society could not come into being and on the other hand in the affairs of the government, a special group was ruling instead of involving the common people.

# RACIAL DISCRIMINATION 

One of the distinctive features of the British Imperialism is her created racial discrimination. During the English rule, in the Indian society the relation of English peoples and local peoples remained of the ruler and the subject. British had never been a part of Indian society. Social activities of British remained separate. Separate parks, clubs and hotels were established for them where entry of the Indian was prohibited. This racial discrimination created in the society badly affected the psychology of the Indians.

The changes brought into being in education, economy, politics and way of living by the British, had a negative impact on the people here. Inspite of the freedom, some of those effects still exist in our behaviors today also.

## ROLE OF QUAID-E-AZAM IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PAKISTAN

Political movements were introduced in India in the beginning of $20^{\text {th }}$ century. The Congress dominated over all these movements. In these state of affairs, the person who not only organized and mobilize the Muslims in their political struggle but also brought them to their destination (Pakistan) was Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He joined the congress in 1906 and started to take part in practical politics. When the Muslim League brought change in her aims and adopted a way of thinking to take part in government, he joined the Muslim League in 1913 and worked tirelessly to bring the two Nations together. His efforts earned him the title of "The Ambassador of Hindu Muslim Unity". He succeeded to make both the parties agreed on a pact at Lucknow in 1916. He resigned the congress in 1920, on the basis of
difference that he did not consider Non Cooperation movement as a right step towards freedom movement.

Quaid-e-Azam fought the war of independence within the limits of law for his whole life and never went to prison. It proves that he acted according to the law and struggled for the achievement of the rights of the Muslims. In 1928, when congress ignored the demands of the Muslims in constitutional proposals, in response he gave his 14 points in 1929, as alternate constitutional proposals. He presented the wishes and demands of the Muslims in a better way in the Round Table Conference. He criticized the act of 1935 but took part in the election of 1937. During 1937-39 he criticized those policies of Congress rules, due to which the Muslims suffered. In 1940, he passed the Lahore Resolution and determined the destination for the Muslims and in a short period of seven years to 1947, he made possible the achievement of Pakistan specially in such conditions when the British and the congress both were in opposition of the partition of India and establishment of Pakistan.

If we want to select one among all the leaders and workers who lead Pakistan movement towards its destination is Quaid-e-Azam undoubtedly. He led the Muslims with more prudence and regulation. During the whole movement he never acted against law. He always challenged the British, Congress and other leaders with the weapon of arguments against violence. He always consulted his colleagues and workers before taking a decision and once he took a decision, he stood on that and never showed any weakness. He used to keep his words. Quaid-e-Azam led the freedom movement and Pakistan movement in such a way that has no example. Many statesmen of the world paid tributes to Quaid-e-Azam. Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison in the struggle against the racial discriminative government of South Africa, consider the struggle for freedom of Quaid-e-Azam as source of guidance for himself.
