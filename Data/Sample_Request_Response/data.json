Differentiate between Atherosclerosis and Arteriosclerosis\n        Atherosclerosis : It is characterized by the deposition of fatty material e.g. cholesterol inside the arteries. Due to this, the lumen (interior) of the artery becomes narrow and blood flows with difficulty.Later, the artery may completely be blocked. Some obvious reasons of atherosclerosis are hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus and increased lipid level in blood\n        Arteriosclerosis : It is the hardening of the arteries due to the deposition of calcium in the walls of the arteries. Such artery cannot expand when blood is pumped with pressure into it with systole. Due to this inflexibility makes the heart to work hard. This disorder occurs with increasing age. \n        ",
